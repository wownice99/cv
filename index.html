    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
        I am a Tech I at Raytown Quality Schools, previously worked in the Kitchen at Little Sisters of the Poor, filled in wherever they needed me. I am currently 22, born in 1999.
        My birthday is September 16th. I have my Associate's in Computer Science. I was thinking about going back for my Bachelor's in Information Technology with a minor in Mathematics.
        I have many interests. Number one would be video games. I'm pretty decent at First Person Shooter type games. 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.counter-strike.net/"><i>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</i></a> and 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/"><i>Valorant</i></a> are the 
        games I currently dump the most hours into. Straying from this path though, I've been playing 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/">Stardew Valley</a>
        . Theres a lot of completionist type content in the game, with a lot of 
        different aspects. I also enjoy coding. I love creating programs, specifically ones that automate tasks. I believe, leave the boring, tedious, and monotonous tasks to the robots. 
        This interest started as any boys dream of creating a video game. Even though this would be amazing to be on a team that creates or develops a video game, I don't have the drive 
        for that specifically anymore. I also really enjoy art. This touches base with the <em>creating something</em> aspect that the coding did. I really like to sketch, but have problems 
        sitting down and focusing on one thing for long. I love learning, but not the biggest fan of school. I need to actually do something in order to learn it, and a lot of the time, 
        schools won't care if your this type of learner.
